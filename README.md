InnoTalent Engine Frontend is the frontend Flutter application for InnoTalent API which is designed to streamline the hiring process for companies. By calling the backend that integrates with five AI models, including one from **OpenAI** and **four custom AI models**, this frontend Flutter Web App provides a means for user to:

* Upload resume to be processed by the backend
* View predicted insights returned by the backend

<br>

The upload page allows the user to upload a file by drag and drop or picking a file from local filesystem:
![resume_upload_page](./screenshots/upload.png)
<br>

After the user picked a file, a preview on the file name, file size and file type is shown:
![selected_for_upload](./screenshots/selected_for_upload.png)
<br>

The dashboard on the frontend presents the predicted score in an intuitive dashboard that provides actionable insights for HR to determine if a candidate is the right fit for the company.
